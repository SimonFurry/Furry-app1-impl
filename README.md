Heyo!
This project was the most enjoyable I have had so far. Something about the tangibility made this a way better learning experience. 
Anyway enough with the rambling prelude and onto the explination.

Add List - The button creates a new menu prompting for a file name, you can exit this menu by entering a name and clicking 'Ok' or 'Cancel' if you want to leave without commiting.
Remove List - Prompts for a file name to delete, exit with 'Ok' to commit change or 'Cancel' to leave without commiting a change
Edit List - Prompts for a file name and a new file name to change the original, exit with 'Ok' to commit change or 'Cancel to leave without commiting a change

Load Existing List - Opens fileChooser, select textfile, loads into 'Items' display.

Fill 'Item Description' and the date box bellow for a new item on the list, click add item to move it onto the list.
To remove, highlight your item and press 'delete' or 'backspace'

Save File - Prompts for a file name and will save file in "Lists" directory within the program folder.

Note: Files will, by default, save and generate within the "/Lists" directory.
